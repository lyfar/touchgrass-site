# Sound healing instruments: a strategic research brief for a premium iOS app

**Your app's current 6-instrument lineup covers the basics but misses critical instruments that competitors already offer and practitioners actively demand.** The biggest gaps are tuning forks, tingsha cymbals, handpan, and didgeridoo—all of which carry therapeutic evidence, user demand, or competitive necessity. Meanwhile, the wood block is the weakest instrument in the lineup and should be replaced. Frequency features (Solfeggio, 432 Hz, binaural beats, chakra mapping) are table-stakes that every serious competitor already provides—without them, the app won't be taken seriously by the sound healing community.

This report synthesizes research across competitive intelligence, user demand signals, published therapeutic evidence, and frequency/tuning considerations to deliver actionable MVP recommendations.

## 1. The competitive landscape reveals a clear market gap

Ten dedicated and mainstream apps were analyzed in detail. The market splits into three tiers: mainstream meditation apps that ignore sound healing entirely, content-based sound bath apps offering pre-recorded sessions, and interactive instrument apps that are outdated and limited.

**Mainstream apps don't compete directly.** Calm and Headspace offer no singing bowls, gongs, or frequency tools. They serve a broader wellness market with nature sounds, sleep stories, and guided meditation. This means the real competition comes from dedicated sound healing apps.

**The Sound Bath app (by Guy & Simona Douglas) is the most direct competitor**, offering the widest instrument variety of any app: crystal bowls, Tibetan bowls, gongs, chimes, flutes, vibraphone, monochord, ocean drums, rain sticks, didgeridoo, and drones. However, it's entirely passive—users listen to pre-recorded sessions, not create their own. PAUSE Sound Bath by Sara Auster is the only app offering tuning forks and shruti box, both uncommon instruments that signal a practitioner-grade tool.

**Bowls by Oceanhouse Media** is the closest interactive competitor—users swirl fingers to make bowls sing—but it's a decade-old app limited to Tibetan bowls, gongs, bells, and tingsha. It displays no frequency information and has dated resolution. No app currently combines interactive multi-instrument play with frequency labeling, tunable pitch, and a modern interface. This is the white-space opportunity.

### What competitors offer vs. what your app has

| Instrument | Your App | Sound Bath | PAUSE | Bowls | Insight Timer | Healing Sounds |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tibetan Singing Bowl | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Crystal Singing Bowl | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Gong | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Wind Chime | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | ✅ |
| Frame Drum | ✅ | — | — | — | — | ✅ |
| Wood Block | ✅ | — | — | — | — | — |
| Tuning Fork | ❌ | — | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Tingsha/Bells | ❌ | — | — | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Handpan | ❌ | — | — | — | — | — |
| Didgeridoo | ❌ | ✅ | — | — | — | — |
| Ocean Drum | ❌ | ✅ | — | — | — | — |
| Rain Stick | ❌ | ✅ | — | — | — | — |
| Shruti Box | ❌ | — | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Kalimba | ❌ | — | — | — | — | ✅ |
| Binaural Beats | ❌ | — | — | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| Solfeggio Freqs | ❌ | — | — | — | ✅ | ✅ |

**Key insight:** No single app offers comprehensive, interactive, frequency-labeled access to all major sound healing instruments. The app that does this first—and does it well—owns the category.

## 2. What users and practitioners actually want

User demand was assessed across App Store reviews, Reddit communities, practitioner forums, and market trend data. The findings reveal clear instrument priorities and critical feature gaps.

### Instruments ranked by demand

**Tier 1 — Universal demand:** Crystal singing bowls and Tibetan singing bowls are the two instruments every user expects. Gongs rank third, with The Sound Bath app offering dedicated "Gong Bath" sessions as a standalone category. Binaural beats and Solfeggio frequencies (not instruments per se, but frequency features) are expected by virtually every user and offered by every competing app.

**Tier 2 — High demand:** Tuning forks (128 Hz, 432 Hz, 528 Hz) are popular for precision frequency work and chakra alignment. Koshi/Zaphir chimes are considered essential by practitioners for transitions and accent layers—users specifically request "more windchime versions that are less repetitive." Drums (frame, shamanic, ocean) serve rhythmic entrainment, with ocean drums particularly popular for their wave-mimicking qualities.

**Tier 3 — Rising demand:** Handpan search volume grew **125% over two years** (2023–2025), making it one of the fastest-growing sound healing instruments. Tongue drums are gaining traction through Meinl Sonic Energy's new product lines. Kalimba appears in the Healing Sounds app and is described as producing "soothing sounds similar to a music box." Tingsha cymbals are a standard practitioner tool for session transitions.

### The top 10 feature requests from users

The most consistent complaints across all app reviews reveal exactly what to build:

1. **Less repetitive, longer loops** — "My brain excels at pattern recognition, and some tracks repeat at short intervals," wrote one reviewer. Users want organic, evolving sounds, not obvious loops.
2. **Fade-out endings** — "When what you're listening to ends, it ends abruptly rather than fading out, which is jarring—kinda the opposite effect of what you're going for."
3. **Single-track loop control** — Multiple reviewers complain that apps auto-play the next track. Users want to select one sound and loop it.
4. **Frequency/note labeling** — "I would love to see what the note is on each bowl." This is absent from nearly every interactive app.
5. **Deeper, larger bowl sounds** — "Would like deeper sounding bowls. Like 12-inch bowls and deeper."
6. **Customizable instrument layouts** — "It's less flowing when you have to keep swiping to another page to sound a different bowl."
7. **Voice integration** — "Would love the option to have a beautiful voice to incorporate with the bowls."
8. **Sound layering** — Users value mixing multiple instruments but find it hard to discover in current apps.
9. **Stable background playback** — "I play it at night and it shuts off within 10 to 20 minutes." Reliability is critical.
10. **Clear, simple pricing** — "The subscription pricing is beyond confusing."

### What practitioners specifically need

Sound healing practitioners represent the most underserved segment. No major app offers a **session builder/sequencer** for designing multi-instrument healing sessions. Practitioners use **5–15+ instruments per session** and need real-time mixing with pitch/key matching. The Didge Project notes: "If you have bowls in C, E, and G, they'll form a natural chord that blends easily"—practitioners need tools ensuring harmonic compatibility. A practitioner-grade app could command premium pricing; Soaak charges **$30/month** for its frequency-based wellness app.

## 3. Therapeutic evidence varies dramatically by instrument

A systematic review of published research reveals that therapeutic evidence ranges from strong (multiple RCTs) to nonexistent, and this should guide prioritization. The instruments with the strongest evidence base deserve prominence in the app, while those with minimal evidence can still be included but shouldn't drive marketing claims.

### The evidence hierarchy

**Strong evidence (multiple clinical studies):**

- **Didgeridoo** has the single strongest RCT of any sound healing instrument: Puhan et al. (2006), published in the *BMJ*, showed that 4 months of didgeridoo practice significantly reduced daytime sleepiness and sleep apnea severity (n=25). Two additional RCTs confirmed stress reduction and mood improvement.
- **Drumming** (frame drum category) has robust evidence: Fancourt et al. (2016) demonstrated **20% reduction in anxiety** over 10 weeks, plus measurable immune changes (IL-4 increased 13%, MCP-1 decreased 10%). Bittman et al. (2001) found increased NK cell activity and improved DHEA-to-cortisol ratios in n=111 subjects.

**Moderate evidence (systematic reviews exist but sample sizes are small):**

- **Tibetan singing bowls** have the most research volume: **3 systematic reviews** (Stanhope & Weinstein 2020; Chen et al. 2025; Li et al. 2025) covering **19 clinical studies** across 8 countries, including 9 RCTs. Goldsby et al. (2016) found significant reductions in tension, anger, fatigue, and depressed mood (all p<.001, n=62). Kim et al. (2023) demonstrated that singing bowl beats at 6.68 Hz increased theta brainwave activity by up to **251%**, supporting the entrainment hypothesis.
- **Tuning forks at 128/256 Hz** are established diagnostic tools in conventional medicine. At **528 Hz**, Akimoto et al. (2018) found cortisol decreased from 0.43 to 0.25 µg/dL and oxytocin nearly doubled after just 5 minutes of exposure, though the sample was only 9 participants.

**Emerging evidence (pilot studies, included in combined interventions):** Crystal singing bowls, gongs, and 432 Hz tuning forks all appear in sound bath studies but lack isolated clinical trials. Gongs were studied by Pesek & Bratina (2016) in n=129 participants, with all describing effects as healing/relaxing.

**Minimal or anecdotal evidence:** Wind chimes, rain sticks, handpan, kalimba, shruti box, wood block, and bells have no dedicated clinical studies. Their inclusion in apps rests on practitioner tradition and user expectations, not scientific evidence.

### What this means for the app

The strongest evidence supports Tibetan singing bowls (already included), drumming (frame drum already included), and didgeridoo (not included—a notable omission). **Tuning forks represent the best ratio of evidence-to-market-gap**: moderate research support, high practitioner demand, and only one competing app (PAUSE) currently offers them.

## 4. Frequency features are non-negotiable for a premium app

Every serious competing app offers Solfeggio frequencies and binaural beats. Without these features, the app cannot position as premium. The research reveals specific implementation priorities.

### Solfeggio frequencies: must-have despite thin evidence

The 9 Solfeggio frequencies (174, 285, 396, 417, 528, 639, 741, 852, 963 Hz) are a **core expected feature** in every sound healing app. YouTube videos featuring them routinely receive millions of views. **528 Hz** is the most marketable single frequency—Akimoto et al. (2018) showed measurable cortisol reduction and oxytocin increase, providing a real (if preliminary) evidence basis. For the other 8 frequencies, evidence is essentially nonexistent, but user demand is so high that omitting them would be disqualifying.

### 432 Hz tuning: high demand, thin science, huge market signal

Multiple small studies suggest 432 Hz may produce slightly greater relaxation than 440 Hz—Calamassi & Pomponi (2019) found decreased heart rate (−4.79 bpm, p=0.05), and Bambi et al. (2022) showed improved vital parameters in emergency nurses. The evidence is preliminary, but **user demand is massive**: singing bowl vendors sell 432 Hz-tuned bowls at premium prices, and practitioners specifically seek 432 Hz content. The app should **default to 432 Hz tuning** for all instruments and allow users to toggle to 440 Hz.

### Binaural beats: the table-stakes feature

Binaural beats deliver different frequencies to each ear to entrain brainwaves toward target states. The five ranges to support:

- **Delta (0.5–4 Hz):** Deep sleep, healing
- **Theta (4–7 Hz):** Deep meditation, creativity
- **Alpha (8–13 Hz):** Relaxed alertness, calm
- **Beta (13–30 Hz):** Focus, concentration
- **Gamma (30–50 Hz):** Higher cognition, memory

A 2019 review of 22 studies found a significant link between binaural beat exposure and reduced anxiety. Technical requirements: carrier tones below 1,500 Hz, frequency difference not exceeding 40 Hz, recommended carrier around 450–500 Hz. Headphones must be required for binaural beats to work.

### Chakra frequency mapping: three competing systems

The most widely used system maps Solfeggio frequencies to chakras (Root=396 Hz through Crown=963 Hz). An alternative Pythagorean system uses C=256 Hz through B=480 Hz, and a 432 Hz-based harmonic system places the heart chakra at 432 Hz. **The app should default to the Solfeggio system** (most popular) but ideally offer the Pythagorean/432 Hz system as an alternative for advanced users.

### Tunable pitch: the untapped differentiator

**No major competitor offers truly tunable pitch with Hz display.** Most apps provide preset frequency tracks. A continuous Hz slider or precise numeric input (20–1,000+ Hz range) would be a significant differentiator, especially for practitioners who match specific frequencies to client needs. One modular synth forum user described: "One of the basic ideas is to find out what part of the body the client is having troubles with and then looking up the frequency that organ produces." The app that enables this workflow wins the practitioner market.

### Two additional science-backed frequencies worth featuring

**7.83 Hz (Schumann Resonance):** Earth's fundamental electromagnetic frequency, falling in the alpha/theta brainwave range. A 2025 PubMed study explored its relationship to bioelectricity and health. Can be delivered as a binaural beat.

**40 Hz (Gamma stimulation):** MIT researchers found that 40 Hz light and sound stimulation may reduce harmful brain plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease. This is one of the strongest evidence-based therapeutic frequencies—citing MIT research positions the app as science-forward.

## 5. MVP instrument recommendations

Based on the synthesis of competitive analysis, user demand, and therapeutic evidence, here are prioritized recommendations for the instrument lineup.

### ESSENTIAL — Must-have for MVP launch

These instruments should ship at launch. The first four are already in the app.

1. **Tibetan Singing Bowl** ✅ (already included) — The cornerstone instrument. 3 systematic reviews, 19 clinical studies. Consider adding deeper/larger bowl variants, as users specifically request "12-inch bowls and deeper."
2. **Crystal/Quartz Singing Bowl** ✅ (already included) — Second most popular instrument. Ensure bowls are available in all 7 chakra notes (C through B) with visible frequency/note labeling.
3. **Gong** ✅ (already included) — Third most demanded. The Sound Bath app offers dedicated gong bath sessions.
4. **Wind Chime** ✅ (already included) — Useful for transitions and accent layers. Consider adding Koshi chime variants (Terra, Aqua, Aria, Ignis) as premium content.
5. **Tingsha Cymbals / Meditation Bell** ❌ (missing — ADD) — Standard in virtually every sound bath for session transitions and attention resets. The Bowls app includes tingsha. This is a simple, high-impact addition.
6. **Binaural Beats engine** ❌ (missing — ADD) — Table-stakes feature offered by Insight Timer, Headspace (focus music), Healing Sounds, and every frequency-based competitor. Without it, the app can't compete.
7. **Solfeggio frequency support** ❌ (missing — ADD) — All 9 frequencies (174–963 Hz) are expected. 528 Hz should be featured prominently.

### NICE-TO-HAVE — Add in v1.1–v1.2

These instruments significantly enhance the app's credibility and breadth without being critical for launch.

1. **Tuning Fork** (128 Hz, 432 Hz, 528 Hz) — Only PAUSE by Sara Auster offers this. Moderate therapeutic evidence, high practitioner demand. Include the three most popular frequencies as presets.
2. **Handpan / Hang Drum** — The fastest-growing sound healing instrument (125% search volume increase). No competing app includes it. A true first-mover advantage.
3. **Didgeridoo Drone** — Strongest clinical evidence of any sound healing instrument (BMJ-published RCT). Unique deep-frequency sound that no interactive app offers.
4. **Ocean Drum** — Upgrade/variant of the existing frame drum. Creates wave-like sounds. Featured in The Sound Bath and 3D Soundbath apps.
5. **Frame Drum** ✅ (already included) — Keep, but consider renaming or repositioning as "Shamanic Drum" to better align with sound healing terminology and user expectations.

### CAN WAIT — v2.0+

Interesting but niche instruments that appeal to specific practitioner segments.

1. **Kalimba / Thumb Piano** — Listed in the Healing Sounds app. Pleasant but not central to sound healing tradition. Anecdotal evidence only.
2. **Shruti Box / Tanpura Drone** — Used by Sara Auster's PAUSE app. Niche demand from Indian classical music-influenced practitioners.
3. **Rain Stick** — Included in The Sound Bath app. Minimal therapeutic evidence. Nice ambient texture but not critical.
4. **Tongue Drum / Steel Tongue Drum** — Growing market presence through Meinl Sonic Energy. Similar sonic niche to handpan.

### SHOULD REMOVE or REPLACE

**Wood Block** — This is the weakest instrument in the current lineup. **No competing sound healing app includes it.** It has zero therapeutic evidence, no user demand in sound healing contexts, and no practitioner association with healing work. It functions as a basic percussion instrument with no sustained tone, no frequency richness, and no meditative quality. **Replace it with Tingsha Cymbals / Meditation Bell**, which serves a similar "percussive accent" role but is authentically associated with sound healing and meditation practice.

## 6. The 10 missing instruments, ranked by priority

| Rank | Instrument | Why It's Missing Matters | Competitive Pressure | Evidence | User Demand |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Tingsha / Meditation Bell** | Standard in every sound bath; transition tool | High (Bowls app has it) | Minimal but traditional | Very High |
| 2 | **Tuning Fork (528/432/128 Hz)** | Only PAUSE offers it; frequency precision tool | Low (first-mover potential) | Moderate | High |
| 3 | **Handpan** | 125% search growth; no app offers it | None (true white space) | Anecdotal | High & growing |
| 4 | **Didgeridoo Drone** | BMJ-published RCT; unique frequency range | Low (Sound Bath only) | Strong | Moderate |
| 5 | **Ocean Drum** | Wave sounds highly popular; frame drum upgrade | Moderate (Sound Bath has it) | Anecdotal | Moderate |
| 6 | **Koshi/Zaphir Chimes** | Practitioner-essential; 4 elemental tunings | Moderate | Minimal | Moderate |
| 7 | **Shruti Box / Tanpura** | Continuous drone foundation; PAUSE has it | Low | Minimal | Niche |
| 8 | **Kalimba** | Listed in Healing Sounds app; accessibility | Low | Anecdotal | Moderate |
| 9 | **Rain Stick** | Ambient texture; Sound Bath app has it | Low | Minimal | Low |
| 10 | **Tongue Drum** | Growing market; similar niche to handpan | None | Anecdotal | Growing |

## Conclusion: the path to category ownership

The sound healing app market is **fragmented and underserved**. Mainstream apps (Calm, Headspace) ignore it entirely. Dedicated apps are either passive listening platforms (The Sound Bath) or outdated interactive tools (Bowls). No app combines interactive instrument play, frequency labeling, tunable pitch, binaural beats, Solfeggio frequencies, and a comprehensive instrument library in one modern package.

The most impactful changes for MVP are not adding more instruments—they're adding **frequency intelligence**. Binaural beats, Solfeggio frequencies, 432 Hz tuning, chakra mapping, and visible Hz labeling on every instrument transform the app from a sound toy into a therapeutic tool. The single biggest competitive differentiator available is **tunable pitch with real-time Hz display**, which no competitor offers.

For the instrument lineup: replace wood block with tingsha cymbals, add binaural beats and Solfeggio support, and ensure every instrument displays its frequency. Then in v1.1–1.2, add tuning forks, handpan, and didgeridoo to claim instruments that no interactive app currently offers. The handpan in particular represents a **true first-mover opportunity**—the fastest-growing sound healing instrument with zero app competition.

The global sound healing market is projected to reach **$8.68 billion by 2035** at 9.5% CAGR. A premium app positioned between consumer meditation tools and professional practitioner needs—with science-backed frequency features and the most comprehensive interactive instrument library on iOS—can own this rapidly growing category.
